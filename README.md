HelloNDKWorld
=============

Hello world using NDK in gradle and android studio

Fill in your ndk folde in local properties with the following line
ndk.dir=your_ndk_location

This app has been updated to build the ndk part as suggested in the gradle examples. Before NDK was supported by the android gradle plugin, this project could build the ndk files form targets defined in the gradle file.
